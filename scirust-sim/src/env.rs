//! Agent-in-the-loop simulation: the gym-style [`Environment`] trait and the
//! [`run_episode`] driver.
//!
//! An [`Environment`] is a simulation an external decision-maker interacts
//! with step by step — a reinforcement-learning agent, a hand-written control
//! policy, or a test harness. The `reset` / `step(action)` shape mirrors
//! `scirust_learning::rl::Env`, whose `step` also returns
//! `(state, reward, done)`, so agents written against either trait can be
//! bridged with a few lines.

/// The result of one environment step.
