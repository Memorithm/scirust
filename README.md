# SciRust 🦀

> A pure-Rust deep learning framework — SIMD CPU kernels, reverse-mode
> autograd, batch normalization, convolutions, and data parallelism.
> (A portable wgpu GEMM is wired behind the optional `wgpu` feature, tested
> against the CPU oracle on software Vulkan — see docs/GPU.md.)
> No C++, no Python, no FFI — just Rust from top to bottom.

## Why?

Existing Rust ML libraries either wrap libtorch (`tch`), wrap ONNX runtime,
or are research toys. SciRust is the middle path: a real framework with
real ops, but written entirely in Rust so you can read every line of compute,
modify it, and trust it.

It's not the fastest framework on the planet. It's the one you can **fully
understand**, modify safely, and extend without crossing language boundaries.

## Positioning

A research artifact: a pure-Rust deep-learning and scientific-computing stack built and
validated from scratch — a runtime plus a transpiler layer — rather than a wrapper
over libtorch or ONNX. The guiding discipline is that every primitive is accepted only
after its output matches a reference oracle, with reproducibility measured rather than
assumed (in several cases bit-for-bit). SciRust is not a production competitor to PyTorch,
Burn, or candle; it is a framework you can read, modify, and trust, with its claims backed
by measurements.

## Validated capabilities

Every result below is reproduced by code in this repository and documented in the
technical report ([`paper/SciRust-technical-report.md`](paper/SciRust-technical-report.md)).

- **Deep-learning core + reverse-mode autodiff** — 683 passing workspace tests (0 failures; measured 2026-06-12); an MLP reaches 97.70% on MNIST.
- **Portable GPU compute (wgpu, optional)** — a real WGSL `f32` GEMM behind the `wgpu` feature, validated against the CPU oracle on a software Vulkan adapter (Mesa lavapipe) in CI, plumbed into the autograd tape (`Var::matmul_gpu` forward + backward via `WgpuEngine`) **and** into Conv2d's im2col GEMMs (forward + backward). ⚠ *Separately, a historical cuBLAS-backed BF16 matmul once reached ~63 TFLOPS on an NVIDIA Jetson Thor (aarch64); that CUDA path is archived in [`archive/scirust-gpu/`](archive/scirust-gpu/), not reproducible from today's build — see `scirust_complete_audit_report.md` §5.*
- **Deterministic inference runtime** — bit-exact forward (a 64-bit output fingerprint identical across thread counts and processes), bounded latency (p99/p50 ~1.15), and architecture-agnostic reconstruction from a plain-text manifest plus an SRT1 weight file.
- **Certified-deterministic multi-thread training** — `DataParallelTrainer::train_batch_threaded` runs workers across N OS threads yet reduces gradients in a fixed worker order, so the aggregate is **bit-identical for 1/2/4/8 threads** and equal to the sequential path (float addition isn't associative — the reduction order is pinned). CI-tested, including a real autograd backward. No mainstream framework ships this guarantee tested.
- **Deterministic int8 quantization for embedded** — weight-only int8 is lossless and 4x smaller; a fully-integer calibrated pipeline reproduces the float model bit-for-bit; a true integer convolution and a portable QSR1 / QModel artifact; an aarch64 NEON int8 kernel ~10x faster and bit-exact against the scalar reference; separable depthwise + pointwise convolutions in deterministic int8.
- **Symbolic regression** — a hybrid genetic-gradient engine recovers closed-form laws (structure and constants) from data, fitting constants with the framework's own symbolic differentiation.
- **Evolutionary optimization** (`scirust-evo`) — NSGA-II recovers the ZDT1 Pareto front to within ~1e-3; the simplified single-objective optimizers are honest about their limits (see the report).

## Quick start (60 seconds)

No code to copy. Install the unified `scirust` CLI and run a command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CHECKUPAUTO/scirust && cd scirust
cargo install --path scirust-cli      # provides the `scirust` binary

scirust help                          # list every command, grouped
scirust info                          # capabilities & determinism guarantees
scirust quickstart                    # train a demo classifier (deterministic) → 4/4
scirust som train                     # train the ownership model; accuracy vs baseline
scirust evo                           # minimize a function with a seeded genetic algorithm
scirust diff "x^2 + 3*x"              # symbolic derivative → ((2 * x) + 3)
scirust solve "x^2 - 4"               # real roots → { -2, 2 }
scirust integrate "sin(x)" 0 3.14159  # definite integral (Romberg) → 2
scirust linsolve "2,1;1,3" "3,5"      # solve A·x = b → [0.8, 1.4]
scirust ode "y" 1 0 1                 # dy/dt=y, y(0)=1 → y(1) ≈ e
scirust eval "2*x + 1" x=3            # evaluate → 7
scirust analyze src/main.rs           # ownership analysis of a real Rust file
scirust analyze src/main.rs --sarif   # same, as SARIF 2.1.0 for CI code scanning
scirust verify emit  model.qsr1 model.proof    # seal an inference certificate
scirust verify verify model.proof model.qsr1   # re-check it bit-for-bit
```

`scirust quickstart` prints a decreasing loss and reaches 4/4 on a
non-linearly-separable task — proof the autograd tape, Adam, and the layers
work together. Same seed ⇒ identical numbers, every run.

No `cargo install`? Run any command in place with
`cargo run -p scirust-cli -- <command>`.

## Library API (for embedding)

The CLI is a thin layer over the crates; embed them directly when you need
full control. The 2→8→2 classifier the quickstart trains, in code:

```rust
use scirust_core::autodiff::optim::{Adam, Optimizer};
use scirust_core::autodiff::reverse::{Tape, Tensor};
use scirust_core::nn::{
    CrossEntropyLoss, KaimingNormal, Linear, Loss, Module, PcgEngine, ReLU, Sequential, Zeros,
};

let mut rng = PcgEngine::new(42);
let mut model = Sequential::new()
    .add(Linear::new(2, 8, &KaimingNormal, &Zeros, &mut rng))
    .add(ReLU::new())
    .add(Linear::new(8, 2, &KaimingNormal, &Zeros, &mut rng));
let loss_fn = CrossEntropyLoss::new();
let mut opt = Adam::new(0.05);

let tape = Tape::new();
let x = tape.input(Tensor::from_vec(vec![0.0, 1.0], 1, 2));
let y = tape.input(Tensor::from_vec(vec![0.0, 1.0], 1, 2)); // one-hot
let logits = model.forward(&tape, x);
let loss = loss_fn.forward(&tape, logits, y);
tape.backward(loss.idx());
opt.step(&model.parameter_indices(), &tape);
model.sync(&tape);
```

Add a single crate to your own `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
scirust-core = { path = "path/to/scirust-core" }
```

> built; the bit-tolerant oracle) and a real portable **wgpu GEMM** behind the
> optional `wgpu` feature, validated against that oracle on a software Vulkan

## Package layout: framework library vs. bundled agent

The `scirust` package exposes the framework as a **library** (`src/lib.rs`), re-exporting
the member crates under `scirust::{core, simd, symbolic, learning, solvers}`. The
deep-learning and scientific-computing capabilities described here live in those crates.

The repository also bundles a small **experimental autonomous-agent binary**,
`openclaw-u` (`src/main.rs`, run with `cargo run --bin openclaw-u`). It is *not* a
component of the framework, is not required to build or use it, and can be ignored
entirely. Parts of the repository were developed with the assistance of **SoulLink**, a
separate agent system maintained outside this repository; like OpenClaw-U, it is not part
of the framework.
