//! # SciRust
//!
//! Umbrella crate for the **SciRust** pure-Rust deep-learning and
//! scientific-computing framework. The implementations live in the member
//! crates; this facade re-exports them under a single `scirust::*` entry point
//! so the package matches its description as a framework rather than a single
//! binary.
//!
//! ```
//! use scirust::core::autodiff::reverse::Tensor;
//!
//! let t = Tensor::from_vec(vec![1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0], 2, 2);
//! assert_eq!(t.rows, 2);
//! assert_eq!(t.cols, 2);
//! ```
//!
//! ## Optional: the canonical tensor facade
//!
//! `tensor_canonical` is a compile-time-planned tensor pipeline — build a
//! program, prepare it once, run it many times. It is **off by default**; see
//! its module documentation for the two features that turn it on.
//!
//! ## Note on the bundled binary
//!
//! The repository also ships an **experimental autonomous-agent demo**,
//! `openclaw-u` (`src/main.rs`). It is unrelated to the framework, is not
//! required to build or use it, and is kept as a separate, clearly-named binary.

#[cfg(feature = "tensor-canonical")]
pub mod tensor_canonical {
    //! The canonical tensor facade: plan a computation once, run it many times.
    //!
    //! **Optional.** Enable one of two features:
    //!
    //! ```toml
    //! # The facade, with a backend you supply yourself.
    //! scirust = { version = "0.14", features = ["tensor-canonical"] }
    //!
    //! # The facade plus the deterministic CPU adapter, ready to run.
    //! scirust = { version = "0.14", features = ["tensor-canonical-cpu"] }
    //! ```
    //!
    //! Neither is in `default`, so a plain `scirust` dependency compiles exactly as
    //! it did before this module existed. Neither activates wgpu or CUDA, and
    //! neither adds an external crate to the lockfile: every crate behind them is a
    //! pure-Rust workspace member.
    //!
    //! Two further features add a device backend: `tensor-canonical-wgpu` and
    //! `tensor-canonical-cuda`. They are described below.
    //!
    //! # Which feature
    //!
    //! `tensor-canonical` gives you the whole pipeline but no backend — you pass
    //! your own [`ComputeBackend`] implementation to [`ReferencePlanRuntime::new`].
    //! The choice of device stays yours.
    //!
    //! `tensor-canonical-cpu` additionally re-exports `CpuComputeAdapter`, the
    //! deterministic CPU Reference interpreter, so a program runs immediately:
    //!
    //! ```ignore
    //! let runtime = ReferencePlanRuntime::new(CpuComputeAdapter::new());
    //! ```
    //!
    //! That adapter lives in a crate called `scirust-gpu` for historical reasons.
    //! The name is misleading and the feature is named after what it actually
    //! provides: its default build carries no GPU code at all.
    //!
    //! `tensor-canonical-wgpu` re-exports `WgpuReferenceAdapter`, which runs the
    //! same canonical plans on a WGPU device by generating one specialised WGSL
    //! shader per logical kernel:
    //!
    //! ```ignore
    //! let adapter = WgpuReferenceAdapter::new()?;   // fallible: a device may not exist
    //! let runtime = ReferencePlanRuntime::new(adapter);
    //! ```
    //!
    //! Acquiring a device is deliberately fallible and never falls back to the
    //! CPU: no adapter means an error, not a quietly host-computed result. This
    //! feature pulls the full wgpu stack, so it is a considered opt-in. A
    //! software Vulkan adapter such as Mesa lavapipe is a valid WGPU device and
    //! is reported as `WgpuDeviceClass::SoftwareCpu` rather than passed off as
    //! hardware.
    //!
    //! `tensor-canonical-cuda` re-exports `CudaReferenceAdapter`, which runs the
    //! same canonical plans on an NVIDIA device by generating one specialised
    //! CUDA C kernel per logical kernel and compiling it with NVRTC:
    //!
    //! ```ignore
    //! let adapter = CudaReferenceAdapter::new(0)?;  // fallible, and the ordinal is explicit
    //! let runtime = ReferencePlanRuntime::new(adapter);
    //! ```
    //!
    //! It adds no external crate beyond the `cudarc` the workspace already
    //! vendors, and building it needs no CUDA toolkit. *Running* it needs three
    //! things at run time — the CUDA driver library (`libcuda`), the NVRTC
    //! runtime compiler (`libnvrtc`) and a real device — and each absence is
    //! reported distinctly, none of them with a fallback. The driver and the
    //! device are established when the adapter is constructed; NVRTC is not
    //! predicted at all, and an unusable one surfaces when `prepare` actually
    //! compiles a kernel. The device ordinal is always explicit: there is no
    //! default, no fallback to device zero and no implicit selection of another
    //! device. Nothing is ever computed on the host and presented as a CUDA
    //! result.
    //!
    //! What the CUDA path does *not* do, deliberately: no multi-GPU, no NCCL, no
    //! graph capture, no multiple streams, no kernel fusion, no performance
    //! tuning. One device, one ordered stream, the same eight operations, `f32`
    //! only. Every kernel is compiled during `prepare`; execution generates,
    //! compiles and loads nothing, and one prepared session serves any number of
    //! executions.
    //!
    //! Reproducibility differs between the backends and is stated plainly:
    //! `reshape` and `permute` move raw words and are bit-identical across all
    //! three, as is `relu` on the CUDA path (it selects words rather than
    //! computing), while the arithmetic operations are `f32` and are not
    //! promised to be bit-identical across architectures.
    //!
    //! # Usage
    //!
    //! ```ignore
    //! use scirust::tensor_canonical::{
    //!     CanonicalInputs, CanonicalProgram, CpuComputeAdapter, ReferencePlanRuntime, TensorND,
    //! };
    //!
    //! let mut program = CanonicalProgram::new();
    //! let x = program.input("x", &[2, 2])?;
    //! let bias = program.constant(TensorND::try_new(vec![1.0; 4], vec![2, 2])?)?;
    //! let biased = program.add(x, bias)?;
    //! let y = program.relu(biased)?;
    //! program.set_outputs([y])?;
    //!
    //! let session = program.prepare(ReferencePlanRuntime::new(CpuComputeAdapter::new()))?;
    //!
    //! let values = TensorND::try_new(vec![-2.0, 0.0, 1.0, 3.0], vec![2, 2])?;
    //! let mut inputs = CanonicalInputs::new();
    //! inputs.bind(x, &values);
    //!
    //! let outputs = session.execute(&inputs)?;
    //! ```
    //!
    //! A runnable version is `examples/canonical_tensor_cpu.rs`, built with
    //! `cargo run --features tensor-canonical-cpu --example canonical_tensor_cpu`.
    //!
    //! # What it does and does not do
    //!
    //! * **`f32` only.** Values are [`TensorND`] — dense row-major host memory, no
    //!   device field, no dtype field.
    //! * **No broadcasting.** Binary operations require identical shapes, because
    //!   the canonical IR compares whole tensor types.
    //! * **Eight operations**: `add`, `sub`, `mul`, `div`, `relu`, `scale`,
    //!   `reshape`, `permute`. `exp`, `log` and `matmul` are deliberately absent —
    //!   the layers below reject them, so offering them would advertise a
    //!   capability that does not exist.
    //! * **Prepare once, execute many times.** [`CanonicalProgram::prepare`]
    //!   consumes the program and compiles every kernel; execution recompiles
    //!   nothing and keeps no state between runs.
    //! * **No autograd, no training, no session serialisation.** This is an
    //!   inference-shaped execution path, not a learning framework. For gradients,
    //!   use the eager [`crate::core`] tape instead.
    //! * **Backend implementers** need more than [`ComputeBackend`] — the trait's
    //!   associated types and `KernelModule`, `DeviceCapabilities`, `BufferBinding`,
    //!   `LaunchConfig` and `MemorySpace` come from `scirust-compute`, which such a
    //!   caller should depend on directly.
    //!
    //! # A name worth knowing about
    //!
    //! [`TensorND`] here is `scirust_tensor_core::TensorND`, backed by a
    //! `Vec<f32>`. It is **a different type** from `scirust::core::tensor::TensorND`,
    //! which is backed by an `Arc<[f32]>` and belongs to the eager stack. They share
    //! a name and nothing else, which is why neither appears in [`crate::prelude`].
