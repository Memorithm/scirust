//! Tensor graph compilation for SciRust.
//!
//! # Canonical compilation pipeline
//!
//! Four successive descriptions of one computation, each answering a different
//! question and none of them containing backend state:
//!
//! 1. **Canonical IR** — [`scirust_tensor_ir::Graph`]: *what* is computed. Graph
//!    structure and tensor metadata, no payload, no device, no kernel.
//! 2. **Execution plan** — [`ExecutionPlan`], from [`CanonicalCompiler`]: *in
//!    which order*. Validated graph, dead nodes eliminated, topological order,
//!    canonical [`scirust_tensor_ir::NodeId`] preserved.
//! 3. **Memory plan** — [`MemoryPlan`]: *in which logical buffer* each value
//!    lives. Logical [`BufferSlot`]s with deterministic reuse after last use,
//!    external inputs and constants kept distinct from internal buffers. No
//!    physical allocation, no memory space, no alignment, no device ownership.
//! 4. **Lowered plan** — [`LoweredPlan`], from [`KernelLowerer`]: *by which
//!    logical kernel*, fed by which logical arguments. Detailed below.
//!
//! # Logical binding versus physical buffer binding
//!
//! A [`KernelArgument`] is a *logical* binding. It names a role — "the second
//! read operand of this dispatch" — and the value that fills it, as one of an
//! external input, an external constant, or an internal logical buffer slot. It
//! carries no pointer, no byte offset, no length, no device, no lifetime.
//!
//! The physical counterpart, `scirust_compute::BufferBinding`, is a different
//! object entirely: it is generic over a backend buffer type, borrows that
//! buffer for a lifetime, and carries byte offsets and lengths that only a
//! runtime that has actually allocated memory can know. The mapping between the
//! two is a *runtime* responsibility, and deliberately not expressed here.
//!
//! The same separation applies to launch geometry. [`LogicalDispatch`] states an
//! iteration space; it is not `scirust_compute::LaunchConfig`, which carries
//! grid, block and shared-memory sizes that are tuned per backend (WGPU, for
//! instance, encodes workgroup size in the shader itself and requires a unit
//! block, while CUDA does not).
//!
//! # Why the lowered plan holds no compiled kernel
//!
//! A [`LogicalKernel`] is a *signature to be generated*, never generated code.
//! `scirust_compute::KernelModule` holds a byte payload in one concrete format
//! (`Reference`, `Wgsl`, `SpirV`, `Ptx`); producing one requires committing to a
//! target. WGSL and PTX emission is therefore necessarily target-specific and
//! stays out of this phase: a single logical plan is meant to be consumed by
//! several independent generators.
//!
//! ```text
//! LoweredPlan
//!   → ReferenceGenerator → KernelModule { format: Reference, .. }
//!   → WgslGenerator      → KernelModule { format: Wgsl, .. }
//!   → PtxGenerator       → KernelModule { format: Ptx, .. }
//! ```
//!
//! A [`LoweredPlan`] is a description rather than an executable artefact; kernel
//! generation and execution remain responsibilities of downstream crates.
//!
//! # Deterministic invariants of the lowered plan
//!
//! * Lowered instructions follow the canonical order of
//!   [`ExecutionPlan::instructions`].
//! * Arguments are ordered read operands first, in the exact order of
//!   [`Instruction::inputs`], then the single write result. The logical index of
//!   an argument equals its position.
//! * [`LogicalKernelId`] is the position of the kernel in
//!   [`LoweredPlan::kernels`], assigned on first use in canonical order.
//! * [`LogicalBindingId`] is the position of the entry in the external binding
//!   table supplied to [`KernelLowerer::lower`].
//! * Outputs keep the order declared by [`ExecutionPlan::outputs`].
//! * No identifier derives from an address, a randomly seeded hash, a hash-map
//!   iteration order, a device, or an execution context. Internal lookups use
//!   ordered maps and stably built vectors only.
//!
//! # Operations supported and rejected by lowering
//!
//! Supported in this phase:
//!
//! * `Add`, `Sub`, `Mul`, `Div` — [`KernelFamily::ElementwiseBinary`];
//! * `Relu`, `Exp`, `Log`, `ZerosLike`, `OnesLike`, `Scale` —
//!   [`KernelFamily::ElementwiseUnary`];
//! * rank-2 `MatMul` — [`KernelFamily::MatMul`];
//! * identical-prefix `BatchMatMul` — [`KernelFamily::BatchMatMul`];
//! * `Reshape` — [`KernelFamily::ShapeCopy`];
//! * `Transpose` — [`KernelFamily::Permute`].
//!
//! `Input` and `Constant` never become kernels; they feed the external binding
//! table ([`ExternalBindings`]) instead.
//!
//! Matrix-product lowering validates the complete logical shape contract before
//! exposing a kernel family: rank-2 products require `[M,K] @ [K,N] -> [M,N]`,
//! while batched products require one identical batch prefix and
//! `[B...,M,K] @ [B...,K,N] -> [B...,M,N]`. All operands and the result must
//! have the same dtype. This crate deliberately does not choose tiling, SIMD,
//! thread partitioning, GPU workgroup geometry or a vendor GEMM implementation;
//! those are backend/code-generator decisions. The Reference CPU executor defines
//! its own deterministic accumulation policy separately.
//!
//! Any operation added to the non-exhaustive [`scirust_tensor_ir::Operation`]
//! enum in the future is rejected with a typed error until a lowering rule is
//! supplied. There is no silent fallback, no no-op substitution and no partial
//! lowering: a plan either lowers completely or fails.
//!
//! # Semantic validation performed while lowering
//!
//! [`KernelLowerer::lower`] validates operand types, matrix-product shapes,
//! reshape consistency and transpose permutations. These checks are invariants
//! a code generator must be able to trust. They complement canonical Tensor IR
//! semantic validation rather than weaken it.
//!
//! # Legacy element-wise fusion compiler
//!
//! The original, still supported entry point is unrelated to the pipeline above:
//! a chain of element-wise operations (scale, bias, ReLU, …) is compiled into a
//! single [`FusedKernel`] that is evaluated in **one pass** over the data,
//! instead of materialising an intermediate tensor per operation. This is the
//! same memory-bandwidth win described for the tensor stack: fewer passes, fewer
//! temporaries.
