//! Logical kernel-lowering contract for canonical execution plans.
//!
//! This module is private; every type below is re-exported at the crate root and
//! documented there. The crate-level documentation is the reference for the
//! contract itself: the four planes of the compilation pipeline, the difference
//! between a logical binding and a physical buffer binding, why a lowered plan
//! holds no compiled kernel, the deterministic invariants, and the operations
//! this phase supports and rejects.
//!
//! Notes for maintainers of this module:
//!
//! * Nothing here may reference a backend, a physical buffer, a device, a
//!   stream, an event, a compiled kernel or launch geometry. The crate depends
//!   on neither `scirust-gpu` nor `scirust-core`, and that boundary is what
//!   keeps the lowering reusable by every future generator.
//! * `NodeId` values are *not* positions: dead-code elimination in
//!   [`crate::CanonicalCompiler`] keeps original identifiers while dropping
//!   nodes, so every lookup goes through an ordered map, never through indexing
//!   by `NodeId::get`.
//! * The public lowering path contains no `unwrap`, `expect`, `panic!` or
//!   unchecked indexing. Every failure is a typed [`LoweringError`].
