//! Backend-neutral representation planning for canonical tensor values.
//!
//! A [`RepresentationPlan`] is deliberately separate from [`crate::TensorType`].
//! `TensorType` describes the logical value (`dtype`, `shape`); this module
//! describes how that value may be represented for storage or execution.
//!
//! Representations are interned in a [`RepresentationPlan`] through a strict
//! declaration order: a representation may only be defined over components
//! referencing strictly earlier representation identifiers. Cycles are
//! therefore impossible by construction, mirroring how the canonical
//! [`Graph`] only permits inputs referring to previously created nodes.
//!
//! Dense storage remains the identity representation.
//! [`PrimitiveRepresentation::Factorized`] is the first composite family whose
//! reconstruction contract is complete enough to bind to a logical tensor:
//! two matrix factors must contract exactly to the logical matrix shape.
//!
//! [`PrimitiveRepresentation::Quantized`] and [`PrimitiveRepresentation::Sparse`]
//! remain declaration skeletons. [`PrimitiveRepresentation::QuantizedPerTensor`]
//! is the first quantized family with complete reconstruction geometry: integer
//! codes have exactly the logical tensor shape and one scalar floating scale is
//! shared by the complete tensor. Reconstruction is `logical = code * scale`, so
//! the affine zero-point is fixed to zero and occupies no physical storage.
//!
//! Codebook layouts, block geometry, non-zero affine zero-points, packed/sub-bit
//! payloads, sparse formats, cost models and backend-specific materialization remain
//! intentionally out of scope.
