//! Radar signal processing.
//!
//! Pulse-compression waveforms ([`waveform`]), matched filtering
//! ([`matched_filter`]) and constant-false-alarm-rate detection ([`cfar`]) —
//! the range-processing and detection core of a pulse-Doppler radar, built
//! directly on this crate's [`Complex`](crate::complex::Complex) primitive. A
//! long coded pulse is transmitted for energy, compressed on receive into a
//! sharp peak at the echo delay (resolution set by the bandwidth, not the pulse
//! length), then thresholded adaptively so the false-alarm rate stays fixed as
//! the noise/clutter level varies.
//!
//! Alongside the pulse chain sit array processing ([`beamform`], [`doa`],
//! [`music`], [`esprit`]) for angle estimation — from the conventional
//! beamformer through MVDR/Capon to the MUSIC and ESPRIT subspace methods —
//! [`fmcw`] for the continuous-wave /
//! mmWave model, where range and velocity fall out of two FFTs of the mixer's
//! beat signal rather than a matched filter, [`detect`] for the 2-D detection
//! stage — CFAR over the range-Doppler map followed by clustering of the
//! detections into target centroids — and [`track`] for the temporal layer that
//! associates those centroids across frames and smooths them with α–β track
//! filters, with [`kalman`] adding a full constant-velocity Kalman filter and
//! an Interacting-Multiple-Model estimator for manoeuvring targets, and
//! [`imm2d`] extending that to a planar coordinated-turn IMM (a general linear
//! Kalman filter blending constant-velocity and constant-turn-rate models) for
//! tracking turning targets in the (x, y) plane, [`ekf`] adding an extended
//! Kalman filter that tracks a Cartesian state directly from raw polar
//! (range/bearing) radar measurements, [`mtt`] closing the loop with a
//! multi-target tracker of per-target EKFs associated by a statistical
//! (normalised-innovation-squared) validation gate, and [`pda`] adding a
//! probabilistic data association filter that tracks through clutter by
//! soft-combining every gated measurement instead of a hard nearest-neighbour
//! pick. [`micro_doppler`] adds the time–frequency signature of target
//! micro-motion (a Hann-windowed spectrogram plus ridge / bulk-Doppler /
//! bandwidth / cadence descriptors) for target classification, and
//! [`swerling`] for detection statistics — the probability of detecting a
//! fluctuating or steady target versus SNR (Swerling I closed form and
//! Albersheim's equation), the complement to the CFAR threshold — and
//! [`range_equation`] for the link budget: the SNR a radar delivers on a target
//! of a given RCS at range, and the maximum detection range that closes with the
//! [`swerling`] required SNR.
