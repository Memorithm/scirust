//! Radar signal processing.
//!
//! Pulse-compression waveforms ([`waveform`]), matched filtering
//! ([`matched_filter`]) and constant-false-alarm-rate detection ([`cfar`]) —
//! the range-processing and detection core of a pulse-Doppler radar, built
//! directly on this crate's [`Complex`](crate::complex::Complex) primitive. A
//! long coded pulse is transmitted for energy, compressed on receive into a
//! sharp peak at the echo delay (resolution set by the bandwidth, not the pulse
//! length), then thresholded adaptively so the false-alarm rate stays fixed as
//! the noise/clutter level varies.
//!
//! Alongside the pulse chain sit array processing ([`beamform`], [`doa`],
//! [`music`]) for angle estimation — from the conventional beamformer through
//! MVDR/Capon to the MUSIC subspace method — [`fmcw`] for the continuous-wave /
//! mmWave model, where range and velocity fall out of two FFTs of the mixer's
//! beat signal rather than a matched filter, and [`detect`] for the 2-D
//! detection stage: CFAR over the range-Doppler map followed by clustering of
//! the detections into target centroids.
