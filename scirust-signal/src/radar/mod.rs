//! Radar signal processing.
//!
//! Pulse-compression waveforms ([`waveform`]), matched filtering
//! ([`matched_filter`]) and constant-false-alarm-rate detection ([`cfar`]) —
//! the range-processing and detection core of a pulse-Doppler radar, built
//! directly on this crate's [`Complex`](crate::complex::Complex) primitive. A
//! long coded pulse is transmitted for energy, compressed on receive into a
//! sharp peak at the echo delay (resolution set by the bandwidth, not the pulse
//! length), then thresholded adaptively so the false-alarm rate stays fixed as
//! the noise/clutter level varies.
//!
//! Alongside the pulse chain sit array processing ([`beamform`], [`doa`],
//! [`music`], [`esprit`]) for angle estimation — from the conventional
//! beamformer through MVDR/Capon to the MUSIC and ESPRIT subspace methods —
//! [`fmcw`] for the continuous-wave /
//! mmWave model, where range and velocity fall out of two FFTs of the mixer's
//! beat signal rather than a matched filter, [`detect`] for the 2-D detection
//! stage — CFAR over the range-Doppler map followed by clustering of the
//! detections into target centroids — and [`track`] for the temporal layer that
//! associates those centroids across frames and smooths them with α–β track
//! filters, with [`kalman`] adding a full constant-velocity Kalman filter and
//! an Interacting-Multiple-Model estimator for manoeuvring targets, and
//! [`imm2d`] extending that to a planar coordinated-turn IMM (a general linear
//! Kalman filter blending constant-velocity and constant-turn-rate models) for
//! tracking turning targets in the (x, y) plane, and [`ekf`] adding an extended
//! Kalman filter that tracks a Cartesian state directly from raw polar
//! (range/bearing) radar measurements.
